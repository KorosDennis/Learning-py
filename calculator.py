first_number = int(input('Type the first number: ')) ; \
second_number = int(input('Type the second number: ')) ; \
print("The sum is: ", first_number + second_number)

# what i have learnt; Python is very sensitive , in this case i was wrong in some point i had interchanged the input and int and 
# the code couldnt run on the terminal
